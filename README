Useful Bukkit commands that don't warrant an entire plugin.

Most commands use the same format

	/command <target>

where target is either a single player name or a comma-delimited list of player
names. When there are no arguments, the target can also be omitted for the
shorthand

	/command

which acts as if you had used your own name for the target.
